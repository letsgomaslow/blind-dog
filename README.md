# Dog Vision
We’re passionate about helping blind dogs lead healthy and happy lives. We use AI Vision, which is designed to help our blind pets navigate obstacles, and a vibrating collar so they never get lost while they’re out playing. Our mission is to make the world a better place for blind dogs everywhere!
